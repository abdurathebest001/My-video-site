00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.960
what is HTML and what role does it play

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.879
on the web HTML which stands for

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.120
hypertext markup language is a markup

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.519
language for creating web pages when you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.960
visit a website and see content like

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.880
paragraphs headings links images and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.039
videos that's HTML HTML represents the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.760
content and structure of a web page

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.119
through the use of elements here's an

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.320
example of a paragraph

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.279
element most elements will have an

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.360
opening tab and a closing tag sometimes

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.399
those tags are referred to as start and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.879
end tags in between these two tags

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.879
you'll have the content this content can

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.559
be text or other HTML elements both

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.239
opening and closing tags start with a

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.719
left angle bracket and in with a right

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.199
angle bracket with the tag name placed

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.480
between these angle brackets here's a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.640
closer look at just the opening and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.559
closing paragraph tags what

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.120
distinguishes an opening tag from a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.839
closing tag is the forward slash placed

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.520
immediately after the left angle bracket

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.560
in a closing tag some HTML elements do

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.560
not have a closing tag these are known

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.360
as void elements here's an example of an

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.520
image element which is a void element

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.880
notice that this image element does not

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
have the closing tag and it does not

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.119
have any content void elements cannot

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.320
have any content and only have a start

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.000
tag if you want to display an image

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.119
you'll need to include a couple of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.280
attributes inside your image element an

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.560
attribute is a special value used to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.000
adjust the behavior for an HTML element

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.960
here's an example of an image element

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.280
with a SRC or Source attribute the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.799
source attribute is used to specify the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.920
location for that image for image

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.640
elements it's good practice to include

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.200
another attribute called the alt

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.479
attribute here's an example of an image

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.159
element with the source and all

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.640
attributes the alt attribute is used to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.200
provide short descriptive text for the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.680
images in this case the descriptive text

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.759
is a cat sleeping in the grass so you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.599
might be wondering if HTML by itself is

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.040
enough to build a website well the

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.920
answer is it depends if you're building

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.560
a small practice project that only

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.519
displays text and images HTML alone

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.480
might be sufficient however if you're

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.440
creating a modern professional website

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.879
you'll need to have HTML CSS and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.959
JavaScript HTML is for the content and

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.040
structure CSS is for the styling and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.360
JavaScript is for adding interactivity

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.480
to your web pages a good analogy for

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.959
this is to compare HTML CSS and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.080
JavaScript with a complete building HTML

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.159
represents the blocks concrete and irons

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.200
that make up the walls it's the

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.159
foundation that makes the building

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.159
strong CSS represents the interior and

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.239
exterior design that makes the house

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.840
look beautiful JavaScript represents the

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.720
electrical and water system that ensures

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.680
uninterrupted access access to water and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.680
electricity
